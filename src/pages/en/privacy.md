## Data Tilly Processes

### User-Entered Data

- Personal information you add to Tilly (names, relationships, notes, reminders)
- Data is encrypted in your browser before it is synced to Jazz Cloud
- Encryption keys are stored with your authentication credentials so the Tilly server can:
  - Decrypt reminders when sending push notifications
  - Process chat content and forward it to Google for Tilly Chat features

### Authentication Data

- Authentication method and session information stored by **Clerk**
- Encryption keys stored in Clerk to enable access from new devices
- Tilly does not collect personal data for analytics purposes

### Payment Data

- Payment processing handled by **Stripe**
- Tilly does not store your payment card details

## Third-Party Services

### Clerk (Authentication)

- Processes authentication and stores encryption keys
- Privacy policy: https://clerk.com/privacy

### Stripe (Payments)

- Processes subscription payments
- Privacy policy: https://stripe.com/privacy

### Jazz Cloud (Data Storage)

- Stores your encrypted relationship data
- Receives only ciphertext; decryption happens on Tilly servers using keys provided by Clerk when needed for service features

### Google Gemini (AI Services)

- Processes chat content and tool results sent through Tilly servers
- Data sent only when you actively use Tilly Chat features
- Privacy policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy

## Legal Basis (GDPR Article 6)

- **Contract performance** (Article 6(1)(b)): Providing Tilly services
- **Legitimate interests** (Article 6(1)(f)): Service improvement and security

## Data Retention

- Data is stored until you delete your account
- Account deletion removes all data and encryption keys
- Backups are automatically deleted within 30 days

## Your Rights (GDPR)

- **Access** your data anytime using the free tier and downloading your data
- **Rectify** (correct) inaccurate data by editing it directly in Tilly
- **Erase** your account and all data by deleting your account through the account dashboard. This will erase the stored encryption keys and make your data inaccessible
- **Export** your data through the settings menu anytime. You can also import your data there
- **Object** to processing by exporting your data and deleting your account (since Tilly cannot function without processing your relationship data)
- **Withdraw consent** anytime by exporting your data and deleting your account

## Data Security

- Client-side encryption with keys managed via Clerk for multi-device access; Tilly servers access decrypted data only to deliver notifications and AI features
- Industry-standard security measures
- Regular security updates

## Data Processing Locations

- **Push notifications and Tilly Chat**: Processed in Germany; decrypted data handled only for the duration of these operations
- **Encrypted sync data**: Stored in the Jazz Cloud node closest to your location
- **Third-party services**: May process data outside the EU with adequate safeguards
