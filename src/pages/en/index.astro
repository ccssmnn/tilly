				{
					question: "Is my data private?",
					answer:
						"Tilly encrypts your data in the browser before it syncs with Jazz. Encryption keys live with the auth provider so the Tilly server can send push notifications and power Tilly Assistant. When you use Tilly Chat, the conversation you provide is shared with the AI provider. Tilly is open source (AGPL) and you can export your data anytime.",

					question: "Why pay for AI when there are free AI apps?",

						"Free AI apps don't remember and don't remind you to reach out. Tilly Agent has full access to your relationship history. Plus, AI costs money and i want to make Tilly sustainable so I can continue working on it.",
