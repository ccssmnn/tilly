I've always liked the idea of keeping a journal. The romanticized version I had in mind was creating a calm ritual at the same time every day, writing thoughtfully into a paper notebook. But this doesn't fit into my life. Thoughts come and go. I want the most important and recent things right on top. I want to find things quickly. I need the journal to work with how I actually live, not against it.

The breakthrough came when I stopped asking "how should I journal?" and started asking "why do I want to journal in the first place?"

For me, the answer was simple: I don't want to forget important things about the people I care about. I want to remember what my friends are going through, what my family is celebrating, what conversations mattered. That's it.

Once I knew the _why_, everything else fell into place.

## My Journaling Approach

One note per person. One reminder per thing to follow up on. That's it.

The philosophy is simple: remove every source of pressure. No daily quota. No perfect format. No guilt for gaps. No obligation to capture everything.

**When:** Reflection happens naturally. While walking. Driving. After my workout. Whenever I have the capacity. Something sticks with me, I write it down. If I forget it, it wasn't important enough. Instead of writing things down after each conversation, I sleep on it. A little bot of time is a great filter for what actually matters.

**The note:** One summary per person, then entries in reverse order. Newest first. I add to it whenever something surfaces. The notes grow slowly because they're built on genuine memory, not obligation. They are nice to read from top to bottom, like traveling back in time.

**The reminder:** When someone mentions something I want to circle back on, I create a reminder. Simple and specific. For close friends, sometimes just "Ask about her week.". Reminders help me stay in touch when life gets busy. When I see a reminder is due, I find a small moment to reach out.

This works for me because I get immediate positive feedback for asking follow-up questions. The low friction and zero pressure keep me going. 

## The Tools and Friction

For years, this lived across two apps. I used **iA Writer** for the notes (one file per person) and **Todoist** for the reminders. Both work great, and both are available on my computer and phone, so I can use whatever device is at hand to add entries.

But they live in different places in my life. Todoist is where my work tasks live, household stuff, freelance work. Opening Todoist to check on a friend reminder meant seeing all the other noise. It interrupted my flow.

There were two kinds of friction. The emotional friction of context-switching between apps that serve different purposes. And the practical friction of having notes and reminders in different places, disconnected from each other.

That's where the idea for a dedicated space came from. I built Tilly to implement this approach as a single tool. One place for notes and reminders about the people I care about. With an AI agent that adds structure to my thoughts, not to determine what matters. Because convenience keeps you going, and friction kills consistency.

## Where AI Actually Helps

AI works best when it removes friction from what you're already doing. When you write something down, you've done the hard part: thinking, reflecting, deciding it matters. AI can organize your thoughts, suggest reminders, surface old entries, even help you craft messages based on what you've tracked.

But it shouldn't decide what's worth remembering. That intentional choice to write something down is what makes the system work.

## Why This Works

The system sticks because it's friction-free. One place for notes and reminders. One app, not two. No formatting rules or perfect templates. The moment it becomes a chore, you stop using it.

For me, this lived across two apps until I realized the split itself was the problem. Context-switching between tools meant less journaling. So I built Tilly to bring it together: one space for this specific approach.

The best journal is the one you actually use.
