I've always liked the idea of keeping a journal. The romanticized version I had in mind was creating a calm ritual at the same time every day, writing thoughtfully into a paper notebook. But this doesn't fit into my life. Thoughts come and go. I want the most important and recent things right on top. I want to find things quickly. I need the system to work with how I actually live, not against it.

And there was a problem with the traditional approach: the journals I admired required so much effort that I could never sustain them. I'd start with enthusiasm, write maybe three entries, then abandon the whole thing. This cycle repeated for years.

The breakthrough came when I stopped asking "how should I journal?" and started asking "why do I want to journal in the first place?"

For me, the answer was simple: I don't want to forget important things about the people I care about. I want to remember what my friends are going through, what my family is celebrating, what conversations mattered. That's it.

Once I knew the _why_, everything else fell into place.

## The Approach

My approach uses two tools that I was already using: a notes app and a todo app. Here's how it works in practice:

**Every day I actively reflect on conversations**, whether digital or personal. This happens in my head while walking, driving, or stretching after my workout. Something I'm already doing anyway. I find the important pieces and then write them down. No dedicated 15-minute ritual needed.

I've found that sleeping on it is a natural filter. Whatever I remember the next day (or a few days later) is usually what actually mattered. I don't try to capture everything. If I forget something in the moment, I can always add it later. 80/20 pragmatism keeps me going. Perfectionism is the enemy of consistency.

**Each person** (friend, partner, family) has one note. At the top is a short summary, something I could tell a friend who doesn't know this person yet. Could be a few sentences or a few paragraphs. Below that, newer entries come first, like a social media timeline, with a new section for each conversation or memory I want to remember.

For people I only see together, I also create a shared note. Couples we only meet as a couple, or other families. If what I remember mostly involves them all together, my note title is "The Smiths" or whatever makes sense.

**I let the note grow indefinitely.** We can embrace that the journal is digital. We can edit everything. We can add to the middle if something was out of order. Storage is cheap. It's valuable to scroll back and see how someone's life has evolved over months or years. It's a journal, after all. When I update a summary and it feels stale, I do that in the moment. But I don't overthink it.

**When I identify something to follow up on**, I create a reminder. But I'm specific about it. For close family and friends, the reminder is simple: "Ask them about their week" or "Just chat." For others, I create actionable reminders tied to the conversation. If a friend mentions they're stressed about work, I create a reminder to ask how it's going in a few weeks. If someone tells me they're training for a marathon in October, I can circle back and wish them good luck or ask how it went.

This approach works the same for every relationship. Closer friends will have longer, more detailed logs. I don't do this for people I have a purely functional relationship with. Again, 80/20. You don't have to be there for everyone. Make sure you're there for the people that matter to you.

## The Tools and Friction

For years, this lived across two apps. I used **iA Writer** for the notes (one file per person) and **Todoist** for the reminders. Both work great, and both are available on my computer and phone, so I can use whatever device is at hand to add entries.

But they live in different places in my life. Todoist is where my work tasks live, household stuff, freelance work. Opening Todoist to check on a friend reminder meant seeing all the other noise. It interrupted my flow.

There were two kinds of friction. The emotional friction of context-switching between apps that serve different purposes. And the practical friction of having notes and reminders in different places, disconnected from each other.

That's where the idea for a dedicated space came from. I built Tilly to implement this approach as a single tool. One place for notes and reminders about the people I care about. With an AI agent that adds structure to my thoughts, not to determine what matters. Because convenience keeps you going, and friction kills consistency.

## AI and Intentionality

Here's something important: I could lower the friction to zero. Let AI read my socials, record my conversations, allocate everything automatically. But with zero friction, the value of the journal becomes zero. The AI can't decide what's important to me. It can only add structure.

I deliberately don't want my system to automatically scan my messages or calls and log them. I've seen AI friendship summaries, and they're not something I'd actually read. There's something about consciously choosing what to write down that matters.

If something isn't important enough for me to write it down myself, it's not important. The act of thinking and writing creates intentionality. It forces me to reflect on what I actually care about remembering.

AI can help after the fact. It can structure what I've already decided to capture. Organizing my thoughts. Suggesting reminders based on what I wrote. Turning rough notes into polished entries. But AI shouldn't decide what's worth remembering about the people I love.

## The Real Lesson

The system works because it's simple and it respects my time. Every bit of overhead you add is a reason to stop journaling altogether. The moment it becomes a chore, you abandon it.

But there's something deeper: convenience is the real enabler of consistency. Not the fancy notebook. Not the perfect template. Not the app. It's removing friction from the thing you already want to do.

I wanted to remember my friends better. I wanted to reach out with intention. The system I built does exactly that, nothing more, nothing less. And because it's easy, I actually stick with it.

If you're struggling to maintain a journal, start here: forget about the system for now. Ask yourself what you actually want to remember and why. Then build the simplest possible structure around that answer. Anything else is just distraction.

The best journal is the one you actually use.
